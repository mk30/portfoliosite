<h1>Marina Kukso: about</h1>
<p>
  This site shows examples of my work in <a
  href="/mos">mosaic</a>, <a href="/dig">digital art</a>, <a
  href="/public/programming.html">programming</a>, and <a
  href="http://kitties.neocities.org/comics.html">webcomics</a>.
</p>
<p>
My email address is <a
href="mailto:marina.kukso@gmail.com">marina.kukso@gmail.com</a>. Please feel free
to get in touch - this is the best way to contact me.
</p>
<p>
I am based in Oakland, CA, but am often traveling. I'm very
used to remote work and communication, so even if you're not
nearby, please feel free to email.
</p>
<p>
I'm available for work in programming, digital art, mosaic,
collaboration, and I can also teach/speak on any of those
issues. I am also happy to advise/consult on projects, help
you refine an idea, and more.
</p>
<p>
Also, I love collaborating with people. Do you need sweet
art for your music/gallery show? Do you need music
(algorithmic, live, etc.) for your art show (or whatever
else)? Would you like
some visuals for your music? Or perhaps some music for your
visuals? Are you looking for collaborators for a large mosaic
project?
</p>
<p>
Finally, I enjoy working with women of all stripes!
</p>
<p>
Once again, my email address is <a
href="mailto://marina.kukso@gmail.com">marina.kukso@gmail.com</a>. I am
also on the <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/">freenode
IRC network</a> as "mk30" (you can usually find me in the
#sudoroom channel) and on twitter as
<a href="http://twitter.com/marinakukso">@marinakukso</a>.
On github I am <a href="http://github.com/mk30/">"mk30"</a>.
