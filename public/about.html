            I live in Oakland, CA. I make mosaics and digital
            art. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In my mosaic work I primarily work with broken car glass (aka
            tempered glass), although I also make mosaics
            out of more "traditional" materials (ceramic and
            glazed tile, natural stone, and found objects).
            A number of my mosaics have also included
            light-up components and I intend to work more
            electronics into my work in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
            In my digital art, I enjoy creating digital
            collages and web comics.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am also involved with the <a
            href="http://sudoroom.org">Sudo Room</a>
            hackerspace and the free programming school
            <a href="http://cyber.wizard.institute">Cyber Wizard Institute</a>.
            </p>

            You can contact me at marina.kukso@gmail.com or
            on twitter at @marinakukso. I am a prompt
            replier and am available for commission on any
            project - big or small. In addition to solo
            work, I am also available to work on any phase
            of collaborative
            and community projects and to teach mosaic
            techniques to adults and children. Whether you know exactly
            what you want or you have a general
            idea and would like to work together to flesh it
            out, I'm happy to chat with you.
