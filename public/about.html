<h1>Marina Kukso: about</h1>
<p>
<b>Marina Kukso (b. 1984)</b> is an artist and programmer living on the island of Hawai'i. Born in Kharkiv, Ukraine, she immigrated with her family to Chicago, IL, in 1989. In addition to Chicago, she has lived in Durham, NC, Oakland, CA, and now Puna District, Hawai'i Island. "I love to experiment with many kinds of art, including digital, mosaic, ink painting, and collage. I use many found materials because they are beautiful, plentiful, and often free!"
</p>
<p>
I'm available for work in programming, digital art, mosaic,
and ink painting. I am also available to teach/speak on any of those
issues and to advise/consult on your project.
