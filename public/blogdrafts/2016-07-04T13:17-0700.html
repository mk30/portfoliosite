<h1>on fear
</h1>

<p>
i have a fear of physical violence. an alone in the woods
kind of thing. this keeps me indoors at
night and it makes me unwilling to put myself in situations
where i'd be the only woman among a group of men in relative
isolation (see: <a
href="http://www.adn.com/we-alaskans/article/being-female-among-fishermen-unwelcome-reminder-docks/2015/02/22/">being
female among fishermen</a> and <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2305051/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">the
movie "wild"</a>). this is very limiting!  
here are some of my thoughts about fear
and keeping your wits about you.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
try to never find yourself in an emergency (defined as a
situation where you have no options). most women i know are
experts at this.
</p>
<p>
it's actually not accurate to say "i fear having violence
happen to me." i navigate an environment filled with the
possibility of violence (for example, cars), but i'm 
not scared around cars. i'm 
attuned to the risk and i try my animal-best to
navigate through the dangerous situation (see: <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454468/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">the
movie "gravity"</a> and <a
href="https://youtu.be/lEyCq2KRZik?t=2m42s">this perspective
from frank de winne, an astronaut on
the ISS</a>).
</p>

<p>
fear paralyzes you when you need to do
rapid problem-solving to get out of a potentially
physically dangerous situation. you are so gripped by the
"but what if i get hurt!" thought (aka fear) that you
can't start figuring out a solution to the problem.
</p>
<p>
the solution to fear is to accept that something
physically dangerous and/or painful WILL happen to you.
(for example: property crime).
you accept that when you cross the street you may be
murdered by a car, usually (barring personal
circumstances) without experiencing the kind of paralyzing
fear that might make you freeze and grab onto your seat
when the plane starts shaking with turbulence. 
</p>
<p>
if you find yourself in a potentially vulnerable
situation, try to find the most defensible position.
then you can feel confident while you improve your
defenses. 
</p>
<p>
if your defensive strategy is to retreat into the shadows
(see: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXulHHIDHqU">"revealing the leopard" documentary</a>), just remember that you might
find yourself in a corner, boxing yourself
up in a box that is too small for you to actually live in.
don't kid yourself into thinking that you can actually live
in a too-small box. one's humanity has a way of leaking out.
so if you do find yourself in a box, 
start looking for escape hatches immediately - ideally
before you even start boxing yourself up. and beware denial!
there is no shame in discovering that you have been trapped.
there's only forward.
</p>
<p>
on the other end of the spectrum is
"hmm...how could i MOST take
advantage of the situation i find myself in?" 
it's a learnable
perspective (see: <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVhUdhZxbGI">carol
dweck "growth mindset"</a>). if it
doesn't come naturally to you, that's ok. just try to
remember to ask yourself that question when you're in a
tough spot. with practice, it'll become more natural.
