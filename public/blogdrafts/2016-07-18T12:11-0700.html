<h1>why do we analyze movies?</h1>


what does it matter if movies, art, literature, music, and
any other form of cultural production depict women
negatively?

why does sexism in video games bother people? why don't they
make their own games if it bothers them so much?
(materialism)

for humans, good stories about humans are pretty great at
helping people understand something from another person's
perspective.

what it would be like to go through life like this? are my
assumptions correct? which thoughts that pop into my head in
response to that question are just assumptions?

learning/education for youth and for everyone else. it's not
INTENTIONAL necessarily, but a culmination of things have
created the reality we currently find ourself in: where
almost no major, commercial movies are made that are about
the lives of black people in the US.

..same for lives of "non-normative" families.

cultural artifacts both produce and re-produce culture. it's
worthwhile to look at a few cases to see how a set of
circumstances came to produce the outcome we see. as always,
please note that the act of telling a history is the work of
history. (so maybe we shouldn't even bother telling a
history here).
