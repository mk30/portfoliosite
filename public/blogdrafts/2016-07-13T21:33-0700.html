1. i really need to learn regex. write a post about regex.
2. it takes time to adjust to a new place
3. turns out you can just do strange things focused enough
over too-long of a time without enough sleep. you just need
to keep your eyes on the prize and remember that you will
get a whole lot of sleep at the end of this. freeing myself
from the tyranny of too-little-sleep was one of the first
things i freed myself from, mentally. i decided it was
bullshit. and one of the most powerful things i freed myself
from (just kidding. everything you free yourself from is a
giant leap forward in feeling like a human).
(i love stories & art about the quest to become free.)

but all of a sudden it turns out that i can do something for
2-3 days with very little rest and acceptable functioning.

i'm always wondering whether x is something that i used to
not do or something that's "been there all along" but
somehow i didn't trendset it. i remind myself that it
doesn't matter. "this is where i'm at now. now what?" i've
been trying to focus on asking myself this question
(especially when it's situations relating to
powerful/overwhelming(in the 'w/medication life' sense of
the word) emotions).

that's what "think of sandy", "think of people in space like
that guy who had to step out without a tether" is all about.
or that lady who escaped a wolf.

"i wanted to be an astronaut and then i became an
astronaut". i've never understood that sentiment because i
had failed in a number of my dreams. but then i start to
recast the statement in terms of a goal that was so
important to me that i would be fine trying to pursue it for
the rest of my life. and what i got when i thought about
THAT for a little while is "i want to live in as few cages as possible. i
want to always be able to figure out a way to live so that i
can always leave a situation. there is a way out of every
trap!" (this is one of the lessons of hackerism). it's also
one of the lessons of "survivalist skills" and a reason to
be interested in puzzle horror.

that's the kind of thing that gets me thinking about the boy
scouts. in my vision of what boy scouts is all about, i
imagine that they teach the kids "remember kid, there's
always something you can do. you're not dead till you're
dead." and also survival skills. i imagine that through this
training, you can develop the emotional tools to do the
"step into space without a tether thing" (is this what's
behind the idea of the "stoic badass"? i don't think so, but
it's worth a thinking.")

-----------------

"so i've been thinking": welcome to "hanging out with
marina"

glossary

let me explain what you're looking at

----------------

some people might call "speaking with a glossary" poetry
(and maybe it IS their poetry. this is certainly MY poetry.
i have no other poetry)(on the topic of poetry, it was
really xxxxxx who got me thinking of poetry as a how-to
manual with a glossary developed by the poetry. that's why i
think of this as MY poetry.)
but i just call it theory. if every philosopher and their
brother gets to say similar shit with a slightly different
metaphor than the metaphor they used to use, then i do too.
cuz none of their stories work for me! they don't reflect
anything of my own experiences. i take nothing from them!
except freire. i need to re-read pedagogy of the oppressed
with the perspective of WOMEN, but of course never
forgetting the context that the book was written in.

----------

one of the reasons i'm writing this is because i have too
many forgotten technologies. "i swear i figured out how to
do x but i cannot for the life of me replicate what i did
AND i can't find any record of how i did it. fuck
everything." i search my goddamn tumblr and twitter one
fucking "show more"/"next page" click at a time. AND i felt
as if i "got permission" to write like this by johnny, who
recently said "wouldn't it be great to have your own wiki of
your own ideas and thoughts?" and i was like uhhh YEAAAAAH
i've been wanting to do this for ev er because i can never
find any of the shit i supposedly know/figured out! and that
fucking SUCKS. i'm just hoping that writing this stuff down
will help ("take notes! write an essay! writing is the part
where you do the figuring out! 'do i have something
cool/that makes sense?' you can only answer that by actually
writing it. or actually drawing it. or actually building it.
that sentiment really helps take the edge off "oh what's the
point in writing. everyone thinks they have something
worthwhile to share with the world." but that ignores the
fact that you get better at it over time and that one of the
purposes of sharing is to get feedback from your peers.
that's why we have a "shared blog" where we share
discoveries. the kinds of discoveries i'm interested in have
to do with "being alive tricks". i call it science (in the
"it's not science until it's written down/science is just
fooling around written down"), but it's not science in the
"we followed the scientific method" sense. in THAT sense
it's more like case reports, self-reported, on any topic
that the individual feels is worth reporting on. if whatever
they're reporting on is interesting to you, you follow their
writing. but it's gotta be focused on discoveries! even
"small" discoveries: "i have leveled up in salad." "i have
leveled up in being open with my partner." of course the
line between life discoveries that might be useful to others
and dumb-ass shit that belongs in the onion is the line that
it's impossible to police without excluding the good stuff,
so you just have to let it sort itself out. tags (aka
"journals on specific subjects") are the way to go for this
problem.

and then i explore "https://www.wattpad.com"

("evaluating a new service"...sigh..good thing i had to
create terms of service and copyright policy! it was good
because i actually had professionals whose job it was to
help me. but the point is, having done that difficult
process that i knew nothing about, i now 1. KNOW that i need
to be looking at terms of use of websites that let you
create content on it for free, and 2. can read and
understand terms of service pretty well, pretty quickly.
secret skills!

(another hackerism: "yea you just start knowing nothing
about a thing you want to do and then you figure out how to
do it. part of that includes figuring out WHAT you need to
learn. and sometimes before THAT, you need to figure out
what some of the words are that are used in the field so
that you know which words you might have to learn.
unfortunately/fortunately, you learn a lot about the field
by learning what the words mean...even the words that you
decide you don't have to learn too much right now. the
important thing is that now you know there is such a thing
as "Computational Geometry" and you know that

being careful with your body movements. focus on your
movements and where your body is. this is one of the great
things i've been learning. (also something i enjoy sharing
with people)

----

sailing! so many lessons learned sailing. so stupid. but it
makes other kinds of problems seem way less of a big deal.
for example, car breaking down on the side of the road while
you're traveling. a terrible disaster or just another thing
to deal with? you don't even have to say this to yourself to
remind yourself that it's true. it just IS more chill and
less of a big deal. a big deal is just a scary thing that
you haven't thought through what you'd do in that situation.
again, this is what i dream that they teach in boy scouts,
but that probably they don't. but is it what you learn by
going through boy scouts? i have no access to that
information. in either case, i wish i had had THAT kind of
education! but back to the boat/car story. it's not that i
have to say to myself "this is chill", it's that i think
"man this is way easier than that time we broke down on the
boat." number of things to be considering when you're
solving problems on the boat: a million. but you learn real
fast and then at least you're not freaking out while solving
the brand new problem.

turns out the thing is skill in figuring out problems that
are completely new to you. that's why my mom is my hero. i
mean, one of the reasons. see: "mom". (under "mom", all
stories tagged mom, a picture of my mom looking happy with a heart around
it, "why mom's my hero", "i have a lot to say about my mom
and about the idea of mom", "wanna talk about your mom? ask
me anything", "wanna talk about MY mom?", "my mom is a
badass", "stories about coming to understand your mom" (aka
you're not the fancy shit you thought you were...and i wish
i had learned this way earlier than i did! kenneth from 30
rock is my ideal in this goal area.), stories about moms
being badasses, stories about people who loved their mom and
where the story was about a kid first being a dumbass to
their mom and then ending up walking with their mom arm in
arm into the sunset (see: the end scene from "the shop on
main street". think: yes it's sad and scary that in the
movie that scene only happens in dreams, after death...but
just think if it really WERE like that with your mom. would
there be anything better? i dunno! and also its corollary,
your mom is alive NOW. now is the time to cherish your mom
in the small moments that we have together. this last trip
home in june taught me a lot of lessons...other than when
james visited for a few days, i slept almost every night
with my mom. in full snuggle. i feel like a baby! i am
finally going to enjoy the love that my mama wants to shower
onto me! (...cuz i never felt it before.)

---

there should definitely be a "shop on main street" for These
Days. what would it be like? for me it would always be white
guilt: "oh damn i took that professor job through dirty
tricks but what was i supposed to doooo?" aka "complicity in
the oppression of people who are denied easy access to
well-paid work. yes, i took advantage of this. ask me
anything." 

i'm imagining a plot like a white gentrifier is forced to
watch out for black people in the neighborhood. in the
process he befriends a black person and ...

but that sounds super trite.

(whoa: "will 30 rock still seem funny if i watched it now?")

so good to feel strong in the body! you never know what
situation you might find yourself in.
