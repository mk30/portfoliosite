i have experience in:

- cat
- adult human - office politics variety. capable of
  navigating the deepest bureaucracy if necessary
- living with mental illness, living with gaslighting,
  living in mental illness - shaming culture subcategory,
  getting on psychotropic meds, being stable, having a
  sibling on psychotropic meds who is also stable, living
  with a treated mental illness and actively engaging in
  countering the stigma surrounding mental illness by being
  open about your experience and helping people who are in
  various levels of the closet with their problem (emotions,
  thoughts, behaviors you can't control; people treating
  your emotions, thoughts, behaviors as abnormal,
  undesirable, and sometimes even scary; a feeling of
  solidarity towards people who have been made to feel as if
  they were crazy and the people around those people and
  people with disabilities. and when i start to think so
  narrowly, i realize that really because we are all
  imperfect, we must all have solidarity with each other
  because life is hard.
- cultural analysis
- clear verbal communication
- i can clarify what others are saying and make their
  speaking and/or writing clearer, more precise, direct
  without being insulting, and always taking the perspective
  of the questioner seriously (even though i'm not at
  level 100 at that last one).
- long term relationship (heterosexual - with men)
- being married
- being separated and being strangers with your former
  spouse
- marrying young
- marrying young despite worrying that it was very much the
  wrong decision to make.
- having attended a fancy college for undergrad
- immigrating to the US from the former soviet union when i was 4
- being an immigrant who passes for white
- being a jew, specifically being a pro-palestine jew
  surrounded by pro-israel jews and pretend jews.
- being a jew who has gone to the west bank to protest
- running a college leftist newspaper
- pessimism
- being a political junkie in the early days of political
  blogging (2002-8)
- thinking i was pretty cool wrt music but rejecting the
  hipster label. coming to realize i was the hipster. have
  moved on.



i am gaining experience in:

- dog
- outdoor skills (chopping wood, starting fires,
  orienteering on land)
- sailing: capable of being a capable crewmember as long as
  i had captain whose judgment i trusted; part of
  that is realizing that the captain is human as well and
  that regardless of who was right or wrong, the important
  thing is to get out of this thing alive. people treat
  sailing like it's a water hack - how much you wanna bet i
  can stay alive on the water regardless of what goes wrong?
  eh? eh? but people die.


these can be like those cheesy team awards like "best at
shelving books after lunch" har har (the joke is that no one
wants to shelve books after lunch), but you award them to
yourself.




i have little to no experience in:

- children
- auto repair
- medical procedures
- hustling - interpersonal variety. i am actively trying to
  increase this one, but i still feel more comfortable in
  "international non-profit bureaucracy-speak" than i do in
  everyday person-to-person relating activity.
- communication via body movement, although i can understand
  communication via body movement as an artform/medium. i
  love all genuine forms of human expression. if it was made
  for love, i'm interested.
