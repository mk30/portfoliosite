one of the things about being crazy is that you are often
reminded of the fact that you are experiencing whatever
situation you find yourself in very differently than what's
actually happening (as far as everyone else experiences it).

show me a person who has been told that they're crazy (and
they
know that it's true) and i'll show you a person who has a
time in their life that they'd be fine to never revisit. in fact, the less said about
it the better. i'm trying to forget. pretty funny that my
variatal of crazy means that i forget a lot of things but
can't seem to forget those! har har har.

i often wonder whether people who think that they've never
experienced distorted thoughts and feelings (which means
that you are having thoughts, you know them to be supposedly
not the normal thing to be thinking or feeling) are actually
interested in the experiences of people who have been told
that they were crazy or whether the only people making maria
bamford popular are all the other crazies. cuz if so,
there's a lot more of us who are willing to be open about
this than i thought! which is great.

but actually the fallacy is in thinking that there are
cookie cutter people out there. no one is the dumbass that
they claim to be on tv. i mean, they are, but they get the
cognitive dissonance, so yknow. everything i know about the
western canon tells me that the human condition is
predominantly tragic, so like, everyone goes through really
hard things. in terms of the fact that all people have
something happen to them that they experience as extremely
painful..like the worst, saddest thing ever. whether some
people have a whole lot of really hard problems and others
have like problems that like aren't that super "bad" is
irrelevent. we must all experience SOMETHING as deeply and
meaningfully as the most deep and meaningful thing that's
ever happened to us, right? and that experience of it being
painful was similar for both people.

i love seeing peoples' faith in humanity shaken. no one
believes in the project of america more than the onion. i
mean, they used to not (back in the 9/11 days), but now they
do. all i want to say is "why did you think that humans
*couldn't* do anything they wanted to other humans? have you
not noticed which earth we're on? we're in the failed
earth!".

i don't like seeing them sad, but i claim the "band-aid
defense": the best way to remove the band-aid is quickly,
even if it does hurt for a little bit. you'll thank yourself
later." not really. i try to be gentle with most, but it's
hard to not get mad when you know someone and know that they
should know better because you know that they are good
people. it doesn't help getting mad though.
