check up on how many things you're regularly doing
unwillingly. which ones can you accept and which ones are
seriously unacceptable.

nothing quite like a demogogue yelling at you that no you
CAN do it, that's what i've been saying all along!

discovering that i'm a third generation of women who have
chosen to sit quietly in their own thoughts while men
bullshit with other men about totally stupid things. we
can't live this way. made me realize that as a result, i
know almost nothing about what my mom thinks and is
interested in...what her values and priorities are. how she
makes decisions and what she's experienced as valuable and
as dangerous. as a result of THAT, my youth was spent
earnestly pursuing priorities that were priorities of my
father. i didn't even know what the work of either of my
parents entailed because my father's default mode is to
speak with those who will listen (and preferably even
interact on the terms that he finds fair). i don't remember
thinking to ask what my parents' work was. it also shows how
little time my mother actually had to speak with me when i
was a child. in my memories, there really wasn't any time.
she worked all day, cooked and cleaned dinner, helped me
with my homework (if necessary), and cleaned anything else
that needed cleaning. then she'd usually sneak away a few
minutes of peace to watch tv or read a book or go to the
malls.

but now my mom and i have all kinds of projects! we're going
to repot plants and do lots of projects in the garden! we're
going to help my mom do things on the computer. we're going
to spread the load of cooking and cleaning between us. we're
gonna go to the museum. we're gonna go on an adventure. next
year in moscow! i'm going to buy a house and we'll live in it
together! the house will have a kiln for mama to do glass
fusion. and we'll have big garden and animals and we'll live
next to the ocean. marina and mama, walking free through
life, arm in arm. //and no one will hurt mama and no one will
hurt marina. finally we'll have control over what happens to
us and we'll walk off into the sunset.
