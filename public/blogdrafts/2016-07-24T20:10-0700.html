category "not knowing whether x emotional experience you're
experiencing is "normal" or "crazy.""

hmm i've had some anxiety the last few days. what have i
been anxious about? maybe that's a normal level of anxiety?

before i got on medication for depression, i used to say the
same thing about depression: "doesn't everybody look back on
their life and think of it in horror?" it turns out that
that is less common than one might think. i had no way to
know that before meds. there were plenty of well-regarded
people who wore their misery on their sleeves: "could so and
so have even created that art if they weren't
depressed/addicted/violent/etc?". and there were plenty of
people who commiserated with me.

your "yea, i'm chronically sad as well" is either different
from mine or depressed states are very common. i'm leaning
toward "both are true."

the whisper network of people who have been on "crazy person
meds" and are happy to share their experience with people
who are considering or have considered taking "crazy person
meds".

i'm endlessly surprised by the situation that gets people i
know into seriously considering taking medication. our
variety of problems is significant. people on "crazy person
meds" have mental illness, developmental disabilities, ptsd,
emotional disturbances, issues with how their brain
processes information, trauma, behavioral problems, and side
effects of things that they're experiencing in the world.
yet we are all united by being "not normal". i am grateful
that i have met so many wonderful people with very different
things going on than me, and yet some similar experiences.
most notably gaslighting. most commonly in the form of
having all people around them in denial that something's
going on with you. denial, helplessness, not knowing what to
say or do, discomfort...i don't know why they do it, but
they do. "you'll get through this!" "nothing lasts forever!"
"just don't think about it." "have you tried exercise?
exercise worked for me."

maybe one day i'll be able to stop thinking about how
strange it all is. i wonder if that's how people who can't
stop thinking about the former soviet union (me) also feel.
hopefully writing will help.
