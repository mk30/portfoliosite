time to say funny things about americans:

"most americans are crazy when it comes to fire. it's
because they don't know how to control it."

euros always ask me if "america is as bad as it seems". i
guess that's as ridiculous as when americans say "i can't
imagine living in a place that's as bad as x country."

people who think they're fancy and have only had very
limited experience with oakland also ask me this about
oakland: "is it as 

oaklanders: *we're* not doing that great of a job? YOU try
living here given the mess that YOU created.

being powerless in your community means that your community
is experiencing a collective injustice and when you use the
legal system to try and claim your rights, you always seem
to lose.   people who have never had to realize that there
was a conspiracy out there against people like them and when
they tried to get out, they failed every time. and everyone
who was stepping on them asked them why they couldn't get
up.

anyway, "there's no use being mad about it." maybe i really
do need anger management theory. what if i am an anger
addict? what if "getting all ragey about shit" is the only
thing that can get me together enough to create at 100%
focus? but of course that's not true and you know it. i
would happily give away all my rage if i didn't have to be
treated unfairly and disrespectfully and be reminded of just
how unfairly and disrespectfully people like me are treated
unfairly and disrespectfully as often as i get
ragey. because i only get ragey when the EXPOSURE to the
continued injustice happens so often that you can't even
take it anymore. and you don't even care what happens!
consequences be damned! i don't need you people!

(i have yet to get to the last statement. i am still working
on freeing my mind. that's what this blog is all about.)

anyway, i speak with many men about the experiences that
i've had as a result of being in a body that presents as
"female". let me tell you, if you wanted to do a study on
the unpredictable nature of human response to a person
expressing their pain, then try being in a womanbody and
express your pain to someone who has been lucky enough to be
granted manbody recognition by more or less anyone you might
expect to meet, ever. DAMN i would take that manbody one.
but that doesn't matter. cuz magic isn't real.

one of my main current theories is that increased exposure to the
problem can spur a person who is not directly affected by
the injustice to support those who are standing up for their
rights. so it's a different feminist movie every night!
