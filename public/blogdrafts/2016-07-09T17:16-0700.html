<h2>don't tell ME how normal people ought to feel</h2>
</div>
<div>
i don't actually have any further content on this subject. i
don't understand why anyone would ever tell anyone how
they're supposed to feel.
<div>
<div>
<h3>
if you want to tell your friend that given your
knowledge of them and their problems, you think
they might be having a worrisome response to a situation, then just
say that.
</h3>
please don't say "it's not normal/natural to feel like
that". for example, discouraged from saying: "it's
not normal to feel uncomfortable and sad when you're with a
partner you say you love." that just makes me feel like i'm a
crazy person and that there's something wrong with me. that
makes me way less likely to tell you about my feelings next
time. i KNOW it's not normal but what am i supposed to do
about it??? 
</div>
<div>
other times i really have no clue that the way i'm feeling
is not typical. how would i? i've been like this since i was
13. i don't really remember what it felt like before then
except that i felt like a kid. in those instances, it may be
helpful to let your friend know that.
</div>
<div>
when i say these kinds
of things, i try to be as sensitive as possible because i
understand that it can be very sensitive. i try to focus on the
fact that i am providing my own perspective - i am just
saying how i see it from <i>my</i> point of view. so you
might say "i know that anxiety is something that you've said
before gives you trouble. is there anything i can do to help
you in any way? i care about you and i'm concerned about
your wellbeing." and if they say that they'd prefer to not
discuss it, i like to add "i'm always available if you
want to talk."
</div>
<div>
finally if your friend says something that gives you
immediate alarm as a thought that is typically considered
indicative of having disordered thoughts in a way that might
result in a dangerous situation, i strongly encourage you to
let your friend know this.
</div>
<div>
"listen, i know that it might
seem really true to not care whether you're alive or not,
but this is one of those thoughts that i know is often said
by people experiencing ___ [a panic attack, suicidal
ideations, being emotionally overwhelmed to the point where
you can't function, intrusive thoughts, a psychotic break, a
desire to isolate].
</div>
<div>
please pay extra attention when accusing someone of denial
or avoidance or "not facing reality."
</div>
<div>
these are things that
invalidate the lived experience of someone as they report
it. i am able to report on the conditions of my own life.
if i say that there's no point to going on and that no one
loves me and that i'll always be a failure, that's not me
being <i>wrong</i> about the conditions of my life, that's
me reporting to you on how my life seems to me. it's hard
though. cuz sometimes it's racism and sometimes you're
fucking crazy. jk, it's always a little bit of both.
</div>









when i hear people talk about famous inventors all i can
think is "another man given the opportunity and rewarded for
his work. sigh. another dude who rose to the top because
over half the population was not allowed to. another dude
who thought the work was more important than the fact that
their institutions were discriminatory and/or making the
world a worse place." "another dude who didn't have to quit
school or get married or die because he had to have
children." but i also think "another dude who
probably thought that he too was a cog in the machine and
that he had no choice and that he treated people well in his
private life." like that makes any difference.
