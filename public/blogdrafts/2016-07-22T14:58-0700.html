it turns out that i did not ensure that our desert home
would have ibuprofen (or some such similar over the counter
painkiller). that means that due to poor planning, i am
experiencing my menstrual cramps <i>in full</i>. what a
strange world we live in that "ugh i have to feel my cramps
in full
for the first time in ??? time (the "???" means that i can't
even remember the last time this happened to me) is a thing
that a normal person would say. i am so lucky to have this
problem! that i only have to experience this bullshit once
in a great while when i overlook making sure that a
PAINKILLER - a pill that you can take that will <i>most
likely remove your menstrual pain</i> within 30 minutes of
taking it.

i know how many women around the world have a really awful
situation with their period. extreme, long-lasting pain the
entire time; debilitation - literally have to just lie there
the entire time or i vomit and am in pain; low-to-no access
to things they need to keep themselves clean.

anyway, i enjoy thinking about these things that i find
interesting, but i know that in reality the outcome of this
kind of pleasurable thinking is bupkis. i just imagine my
dear brother boris looking at me and going "and what did you
expect?".


"why do i use force? because they use force against us!"

why am i obsessed with power? because i see it being
effective at keeping so many people down. whipped every day.
coerced. gritting their teeth through their tears, bowed
down and submissive 

listen, how bad do you want it? how bad do you want to
accomplish what you want to accomplish? will you put up with
humiliation to get it? will you put up with abuse to get it?
do you REALLY FRICKEN NEED IT. you know what i really
fricken need is access to my meds. what i really fricken
need is a goddamn job. what i REALLY fricken need is to not
get assaulted right now - so i'll keep my head down and keep
walking when you yell filthy things at me on the street. so
i'll shut up and make your coffee so that you stop bothering
me to do it for you. so i'll shut up and take it because i
really need this job. i worked really hard to get this job
and i'm not about to lose it because of something racist you
said or did to me because you can get me fired. what i
really fricken need is for the house to get clean, so i'll
do it myself instead of feeling awkward that i have to ask
you every day to do the basic chores that keep the house
clean. cuz you can't be bothered to notice it yourself i
guess! and so i'll take being handcuffed on the sidewalk,
having you search my car on my own block where everybody
knows me. knowing that you can decide to kill me at any time
and knowing that the neighbors are watching, terrified that
if they do something, the police will get them too.
sometimes that means watching someone in front of you get
killed. what do you think that does to someone?

i'm mad because i can't figure my way out of this situation.
i'm mad because i've been trying to arrange my life so that
i wouldn't have to take this shit. but yet here we are! it
has become clear to me that this is just the way it's gonna
be from here on out, so forgive me if i have my battle gear
always on. and when you tell me that "i just don't see how
it helps to tell the story over and over." "i just don't see
how it's helpful to be angry." having never appeared to be
emotionally impacted by the things <i>i've</i> had to
endure, when from my perspective, if you were put into the
same situation, i doubt that you'd be so sublime about it.
that's why i get weird when you give me a blank look and
seem distracted when i'm sharing personal experiences. all i
need is some kind of indication that you share my outrage at
the injustice. a simple "ugh, that's awful. i'm so sorry
that happened to you!!" is literally all i need.
a sad shake of the head and nods of commiseration will work
too!
