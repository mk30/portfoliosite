<h2>au naturale hamster habitat</h2>

<p>
having recently become co-guardians of a hamster, 
my friend and i needed a way to contain the hamster because it had chewed
through the cardboard box it came in. my friend found a
large goldfish-bowl-vase in the backyard and
jokingly suggested we use it. but it was actually a good idea -
the hamster can't climb up the glass walls. we
filled the vessel with things that were around: grass and
dried leaves, some flowers, two large pieces of apple ("this will be your
food and your drink"), and large, dry
magnolia leaves to create a bit of a tent.
</p>
<p>we watched to see
if our enclosure was working (can the hamster get out? will
the hamster be ok in it?) and made adjustments here and
there. the magnolia leaves actually ended up being very
effective because they are too big and slippery for the
hamster to climb very reliably, so they offer shade without
providing a way to escape.
</p>
<p>
here's what our habitat looks like:

</div>
<p>
the hamster has successfully overnighted in the habitat. i
refilled it with a few fresh flowers and grass and
readjusted the magnolia leaves as necessary. the hamster is
calm and hidden in its nest.
</p>
<p>
a few lessons learned:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the hamster likes shade, cover, and dark. whenever it
got very active it calmed down significantly if given more
roughage to nest in, better shading, a spot away from lights.
</li>
<li>if it escapes, it may not go very far. our hamster
escaped the habitat once but we found it under some papers
about a foot away.
</li>
<li>an au naturale habitat smells like nice potpourri and
looks pretty cool.
</li>
<li>the habitat is like an ant farm for the dogs. the two dogs here have really enjoyed watching it
so far.
</li>
<li>if you have cats or an easily-escapable habitat, you'll
need a cover.
</li>
</ul>
