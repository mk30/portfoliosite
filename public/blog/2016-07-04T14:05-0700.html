<h3>moving forward when you can't predict what you'll be capable
of doing at a given time in the future</h3>

<p>
keep at least 3 ideas in your head at any given time. move
on the ones that it's easiest to move on. reevaluate where
you're at regularly. if you're able to make consistent
progress on one idea, just follow it until you run out of
easy juice ("juice" meaning "the stuff that comes out when
you squeeze your brain out). then decide again what to do
next. when deciding, it may help to write out all of the
ideas you can think of. and if you've forgotten some, guess
they weren't that important anyway and if they pop up again,
you'll act on them then.
