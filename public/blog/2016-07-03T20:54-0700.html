i made this while visiting my parents in chicago.
</p>
<p>
the tiles are leftovers from my parents' recent kitchen
remodel. they are on a mesh and include natural stone tiles
and stone tiles that have metal strips glued on them so that they
look like metal tiles.
</p>
<p>
the shells are from my mother's collection of shells she's
gathered.
</p>
<p>at first i was planning on only using the 
tiles and making something in the visual style of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_Descending_a_Staircase,_No._2">nude
descending a staircase</a>. (NOTE: photographs of all
artworks discussed in this post are below.) but then my mom showed me 
her shells and they were so cool that i decided
to use them as well.
</p>
<p>
in the end i tried to go for something
in the vein of "metal garbage under the sea that's being
taken over by sea creatures and broken shells" without
hiding the hard edges and lines created by the
tiles. by that point i was mostly being
inspired by the work of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Bontecou">lee
bontecou</a>: "Her best
constructions are at once mechanistic and organic" [<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Bontecou">from
wikipedia</a>].
</p>
<p>
finally, i was inspired by a mosaic i saw recently by <a
href="https://sr.wikipedia.org/sr-el/%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%80_%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%9B">lazar
vozarevic</a> at the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade_Youth_Center">belgrade
youth center</a>. it's a huge work that uses a muted
palette of natural stone and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_tile#Smalti_tiles">smalti</a>.
i returned to the youth center the day after i first saw it to
take a closer look, and began to more appreciate the
palette, materials, and colors. i realized the extent to
which i had ignored this type of palette and that it is very
much possible to
create an interesting palette with colors that evoke the junkyard. given that i find myself working
with garbage a lot of the time, this is a useful thing 
to keep in mind. so i kept this bronzey, tan,
black-with-soot palette in mind and it influenced me when i
made this piece.

metal and shell mosaic details:
<ul>
<li>materials: shells, rocks, sea glass, wood, glue, natural
stone tile, stone tile with metal glued on top.
<li>back: wood i found in my mom's wood pile. i
sprayed it with deck waterproofing laquer from a spray can.
i left it to dry 24 hours before beginning to glue.
</li>
<li>glue: <a

nails "small projects" glue</a>
</li>
<li>i left the mosaic ungrouted because grout gets into the
nooks and crannies of natural stone and shells and would
probably ruin the whole thing. also i liked the effect of
everything piled up like sea floor garbage. and the wood
looked fine peeking through.
