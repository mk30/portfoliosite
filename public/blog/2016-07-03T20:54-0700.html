<p>
i made this while visiting my parents in chicago.
</p>
<p>
the tiles are leftovers from my parents' recent kitchen
remodel. they are on a mesh and include natural stone tiles
and stone tiles that have metal strips glued on them so that they
look like metal tiles.
</p>
<p>
the shells are from my mother's collection. she's
brought home shells from many different places that she's
visited.  
</p>
<p>at first i was planning on only using the metal and stone
tiles and making something in the visual style of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_Descending_a_Staircase,_No._2">nude
descending a staircase</a>. but then my mom showed me 
her shells and they were so cool that i decided
to use them as well. in the end i tried to go for something
in the vein of "metal garbage under the sea that's being
taken over by sea creatures and broken shells" while still
maintaining the hard edges and implied lines created by the
 arrangement of the tiles. by that point i was mostly being
inspired by the work of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Bontecou">lee
bontecou</a>: "Her best
constructions are at once mechanistic and organic" [<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Bontecou">from
wikipedia</a>].

details:
<ul>
<li>materials: shells, rocks, sea glass, wood, glue, natural
stone tile, stone tile with metal glued on top.
<li>back: wood i found in my mom's wood pile. i
sprayed it with deck waterproofing laquer from a spray can.
i left it to dry 24 hours before beginning to glue.
</li>
<li>glue: <a

nails "small projects" glue</a>
</li>
<li>i left the mosaic ungrouted because grout gets into the
nooks and crannies of natural stone and shells and would
probably ruin the whole thing. also i liked the effect of
everything piled up like sea floor garbage. and the wood
looked fine peeking through.
</li>
</ul>
