<h2>i've started this blog to keep track of things i've
figured out that seem useful to remember</h2>

<p>
do most people have too many thoughts to have time to write
them all down? in my mind "having too many good thoughts" is
the province of the self-deluded. of course the only way
that you can trust your own judgment of the quality of your
thoughts is to convince yourself that you're NOT one of the
self-deluded. but that would be pointless because you'd
never have access to whether or not you were being
"rational" about that - whatever "rational" could possibly
mean. so given the knowledge that you, too, might be one of
the self-deluded... and this is where i pause and remember
that my discoveries and thoughts are useful to
myself, and are therefore worth preserving.
