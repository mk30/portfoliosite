      	I began painting with ink in 2018 when I received a gift of a chinese ink set. it included a small chinese brush (aka calligraphy brush), an ink stick, and an ink stone. i didn't know how to use it, but i eventually figured it out. i love the flow of ink. the process of ink painting is very therapeutic for me and i love the beauty of the outcome.
      <br><br>
      i've primarily learned ink painting in the chinese style, with influences from <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_of_the_Mustard_Seed_Garden">the mustard seed garden manual of painting</a></i>, a classic chinese painting instructional book originally published in 1679. however, i enjoy adding my own spin on the classic motifs of chinese bird and flower painting. primarily, i take inspiration from hawai'i island, where i currently live.
